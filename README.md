# The Garage Launchpad

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo and install the packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you run into issues, make sure your node.js is updated to a stable version (lts or long term support).

```bash
npm install node@lts
```

Open [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
